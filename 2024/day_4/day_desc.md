# --- Day 4: Ceres Search ---

"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of theCeres monitoring station!

As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with herword search(your puzzle input). She only has to find one word:XMAS.

This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance ofXMAS- you need to findall of them. Here are a few waysXMASmight appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with.:..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASXIn this word search,XMASoccurs a total of18times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in anyXMAShave been replaced with.:....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
